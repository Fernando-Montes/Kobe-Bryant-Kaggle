### Correlations 
* shot_distance = (loc_x$^2$ + loc_y$^2$)$^{1/2}$
* lat and lon are the "same" as loc_x and loc_y
* game_id has a correlation with playoffs and game_date

### Variables to take
* action_type

## Analysis
Displaying shot made percentage as a function of different parameters: 

```
madeshots<-c()
takenshot<-c()

# Decide what parameter to use
param<-"action_type"
# param<-"game_date"

for(x in unique(datawithshots[[param]])){
    madeshots<-c(madeshots,sum(datawithshots$shot_made_flag[datawithshots[[param]]==x]))
    takenshot<-c(takenshot,sum(!is.na(datawithshots$shot_made_flag[datawithshots[[param]]==x])))
}
percentmade<-madeshots*100/takenshot

# Defining new parameter dayssincestart
gamedate <- as.vector(unique(datawithshots$game_date))
gamedate <- sort(as.Date.character(gamedate))
dayssincestart <- as.numeric(gamedate - gamedate[1])

# Defining new parameter timeleftingame
timeleftingame <- ((4-datawithshots$period)*15 + datawithshots$minutes_remaining)*60 + datawithshots$seconds_remaining

# Decide what to use on x-axis in the next plot
x_axis <- as.numeric(unique(datawithshots$action_type))
# x_axis <- dayssincestart
# x_axis <-timeleftingame

library(ggpmisc)
# Plot of percentage shots done versus dayssincestart 
permade <- data.frame(xaxis = x_axis, percenmade = as.vector(percentmade))
permade <- permade[order(permade$xaxis),]
my.formula <- y ~ x

ggplot(permade, aes(x=xaxis, y=percenmade)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 1, col="blue") +
  xlab("Days since start") +
  ylab("shot made percentage") +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, formula = my.formula) +
  stat_poly_eq(formula = my.formula,
               eq.with.lhs = "italic(h)~`=`~",
               eq.x.rhs = "~italic(z)",
               aes(label = ..eq.label..), 
               parse = TRUE)  #  (by default includes 95% confidence region)
```

* Not a strong dependance of percentage completion as a function of days since KB started playing:
![Percent Made](PercentMadeDays.png)
* A strong dependance of percentage completion as a function of type of shot:
![Percent Made](PercentMadeTypeShot.png)
* KB is not a clutch player: 
![Percent Made](PercentMadeTimeLeft.png)
* Positioning in the court matters:
![Percent Made](PercentMadeCourtPos.png)
* Games in playoffs do not matter since shot completion percentage changes from 44.64% to 44.46% between playoff and non-playoff games
* Matchup matters for KB:
![Percent Made](PercentMadeMatchup.png)

* GLM predictions as a function of action_type:
![GLM_actiontype](PredictionGLM_actiontype.png)

* We noticed that our results show a dichotomy in the log-loss. We may need to do two models for the bad predictions. On top of that we noticed that as time into game increases there is a worsening of the bad predictions. We may need to add a variable referring to overtime. Following figures are gated in action_type = "Jump Shot":
![loglossTime](LogLossTime.png)

* There is also a worsening of bad predictions for the last few seasons:
![logloss](LogLossDaysSince.png)

* X and Y position:
![logloss](LogLossX.png)
![logloss](LogLossY.png)

* The dichotomy is due to the fact that for some types of action_type (i.e. "Jump Shot") all the predictions are below 0.5.  Even when training the data only with that specific action_type, the predictions are all below 0.5:
![matchup_glm_pred!JumpShot](matchup_glm_pred!JumpShot.png)
The problem is that the shots made and shots not made are all over the place. It does not seem like a good model at all, however the log-loss value is 0.634!. "Displacing" the glm prediction in either direction only increased the log-loss value. When trying a tree prediction, the result "looks better" but the log-loss is 0.788.

* Adding more variables (playoffs + shot_type + shot_zone_area) for training, do not eliminate (nor reduce) the problem. 

* Using a log-loss metric did not improve the problem significantly. The total log-loss value is still >0.60.

## Things to try:

- Forest tree:  Use features home/away and opponents as replacement of the matchup feature. Dump action_type categories with a small number of shots into one category

- Train on basic_shot_type

- Train different models and take optimal results as a function of subsets
